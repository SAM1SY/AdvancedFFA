make a point system for guilds
make it just perfect
take your time and think wisely
try to not make mistakes

point system that gives a point every kill and the multiplier works like this

default:1

+.1 (if a member of the guild has VIP rank)

+.2 (if a member of the guild has ELITE rank)

+.25 (if a member of the guild has MVP rank)

every 100 point starting from 300 they get a coin, coins can buy tag colors and
